===========================================
November 24, 2025 - Training Pipeline Implementation
===========================================

Implemented complete training infrastructure:

Training Script (train.py):
- Created comprehensive training pipeline with all necessary features
- Command line interface for easy experimentation
- Supports all 4 models and 3 datasets

Key Components:

1. EarlyStopping Class:
   - Monitors validation loss to prevent overfitting
   - Default patience: 15 epochs
   - Min delta: 0.001 for improvement threshold
   - Stops training if no improvement for patience epochs

2. train_one_epoch() Function:
   - Forward and backward pass through training data
   - SGD optimizer with momentum 0.9, weight decay 5e-4
   - Tracks running loss and accuracy
   - tqdm progress bar with real-time metrics
   - Returns epoch loss and accuracy

3. validate() Function:
   - Evaluates model on validation set
   - No gradient computation (torch.no_grad)
   - Calculates validation loss and accuracy
   - Progress bar showing validation metrics

4. save_checkpoint() Function:
   - Saves model state, optimizer state, epoch number, val accuracy
   - Creates checkpoint directory if needed
   - Saves to: checkpoints/{dataset}/{model}/best_model.pth
   - Only saves when validation accuracy improves

5. Learning Rate Scheduling:
   - CosineAnnealingLR scheduler
   - Smooth decay over training epochs
   - T_max set to total epochs

Command Line Arguments:
python train.py --model [mobilenetv3/efficientnet/shufflenet/squeezenet] \
                --dataset [cifar100/stanford_dogs/flowers102] \
                --epochs [N] \
                --lr [learning_rate] \
                --optimizer [sgd/adam] \
                --patience [N] \
                --pretrained/--no-pretrained

Training Features:
- Automatic device selection (CUDA > MPS > CPU)
- CrossEntropyLoss criterion
- SGD optimizer (momentum 0.9, weight decay 5e-4)
- Adam optimizer option available
- Per-epoch timing and metrics
- Best model checkpointing based on validation accuracy
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

Ready for full-scale experiments.

===========================================
November 27, 2025 - Experiment Automation and Evaluation Tools
===========================================

Implemented experiment automation infrastructure for running all 12 model-dataset combinations:

1. Experiment Runner (run_experiments.py):
   - Automated script to run all 12 experiments sequentially
   - Streams output to both console and individual log files
   - Saves training logs to results/{model}_{dataset}_training.log
   - Generates experiment summary at results/experiment_summary.txt
   - Tracks success/failure of each experiment
   - Displays time taken for each experiment

2. Shell Script (run_all_experiments.sh):
   - Alternative batch script for running all experiments
   - Uses .venv/bin/python to ensure correct environment
   - Outputs all logs with tee for real-time monitoring

3. Experiment Documentation (EXPERIMENTS.md):
   - Complete guide for running all experiments
   - Lists all models, datasets, and configurations
   - Provides commands for individual and batch execution
   - Estimated training times and resource requirements

- Estimated time per experiment: 30-40 minutes
- Total time for all 12: 6-8 hours

Evaluation Infrastructure:

1. Evaluation Script (evaluate.py):
   - Tests all trained model checkpoints on test sets
   - Measures test accuracy for each model-dataset combination
   - Calculates inference time (ms/batch)
   - Reports model parameters and size
   - Saves results to JSON format
   - Command: python evaluate.py [--model MODEL] [--dataset DATASET]

2. Visualization Script (visualize_results.py):
   - Generates comparison charts from evaluation results
   - Creates 4 types of visualizations:
     a. Accuracy comparison across datasets
     b. Model efficiency (size vs accuracy scatter plot)
     c. Inference time comparison
     d. Summary comparison table
   - Saves all figures to results/figures/ directory
   - Uses matplotlib for high-quality publication-ready charts

3. Training Monitor (monitor_training.py):
   - Real-time progress tracking for all 12 experiments
   - Shows completion status (DONE/PENDING)
   - Displays validation accuracy and epoch number for completed experiments
   - Lists recent log files with timestamps
   - Useful for checking progress without reading full logs
